# Project Epiphyte

## What is this about?
The world is becoming smaller and smaller very quickly. We are centralizing our day to day communication through a small number of organisations, and as they merge our privacy is eroded. Building secure applications is not the answer to this problem. A new trend has to be set that privacy is a default and not a feature. The idea of this project is an attempt to set an example of software driven by Experience Design but does it while being Free, Open and Secure.

## The brief
Provide a way for people all over the world to instantly communicate, whether that be from a laptop, desktop, tablet or mobile phone. Privacy should be blended into the application in such a way that the user does not need to be aware of it. Where possible use established open technology to decentralise and secure communication.

## Other goals for the project
With project members around the world the project must be truely distributed, we must work on ways to be an effective team without having to rely upon single physical locations. Some suggestions so far have been to rely heavily upon GitHub for code/wiki, Trello for task management, Freenode IRC for chat, and the mailing lists.

## Err, What's the name about?
Not knowing yet what the group will produce we needed nondescript name. It's named after the Epiphyte Corp from the book Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson. Becasue who doesn't like a geeky book reference, especially when the book is about a fictional history of cryptography.
